# SBT browser reload

The goal of this plugin is to enable you editing a play framework application and when you save a file that get hot deployed the browser window refreshes automatically so you can stay in your editor or IDE.

It needs a Chrome plugin, so it wouldn't work in Firefox or other browsers.

This is a proof of concept and maybe not production ready.
